# Robotic Inference Project
First project of the second term in Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree. It was about training a neural network to do inference on specific hand gestures.


The project involved:
* Making my own dataset
* Performing data augmentation to make more data to train on
* Performing experiments to choose the suitable network architecture 
* Using nvidia digits to monitor hte training process 
***
The network model is available here. And the dataset includeing the augmented data is available Here.

I uplodaed them separately because tey were too large to upload on github.
