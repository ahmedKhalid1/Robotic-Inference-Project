# Robotic Inference Project
First project of the second term in Udacity's Robotics Nanodegree. It was about training a neural network to do inference on specific hand gestures.


The project involved:
* Making my own dataset
* Performing data augmentation to make more data to train on
* Performing experiments to choose the suitable network architecture 
* Using nvidia digits to monitor hte training process

The network model is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14cH2MRhxrFHrKvhdqYvxFUmIjperDZEo). 

I uplodaed it separately because it was too large to upload on github.
